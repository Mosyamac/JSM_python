JSM classification
========================

JSM classification method, named after John Stuart Mill, is based on Formal Concept Analysis[FCA][1]

	- Input data for learning are given by sets of positive,
negative and undetermined examples with respect to the goal
attribute ("+","-")
	- Positive and negative hypotheses are sets of attributes shared by positive (negative) examples that are not subsets of negative (positive) examples' descriptions
	- The undetermined examples are classified by means of learned positive and negative hypotheses
